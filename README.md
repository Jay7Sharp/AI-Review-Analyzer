# AI-Review-Analyzer

Businesses often struggle to efficiently analyze customer feedback from online reviews and surveys. With the volume of reviews growing exponentially, manually analyzing them is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. This problem is experienced by small and medium-sized business owners, product managers, and marketing teams who need actionable insights to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Traditional review analysis methods involve manual categorization or simplistic keyword-based approaches. These methods fail to capture the nuance of customer sentiment, such as distinguishing between a sarcastic negative review and genuine praise. Research shows that 72% of customers rely on reviews to make purchasing decisions. A business with an unaddressed sentiment analysis strategy risks misinterpreting customer needs, leading to reduced customer retention and a potential revenue loss of up to 10% annually.
